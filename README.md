# Home Price Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting home prices using various features and regression models.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict home prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The model can be used to help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions about property values.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Multiple regression models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Web interface for predictions (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - streamlit (for web interface)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
